Customer Service Tagged Training Dataset for LLM-based Virtual Assistants\n\n## Overview\n\nThis dataset can be used to train Large Language Models such as GPT, Llama2 and Falcon, both for Fine Tuning and Domain Adaptation.\n\nThe dataset has the following specs:\n\n- Use Case: Intent Detection\n- Vertical: Customer Service\n- 27 intents assigned to 10 categories\n- 26872 question/answer pairs, around 1000 per intent\n- 30 entity/slot types\n- 12 different types of language generation tags\n\nThe categories and intents have been selected from Bitext\u0027s collection of 20 vertical-specific datasets, covering the intents that are common across all 20 verticals. The verticals are:\n\n- Automotive, Retail Banking, Education, Events \u0026 Ticketing, Field Services, Healthcare, Hospitality, Insurance, Legal Services, Manufacturing, Media Streaming, Mortgages \u0026 Loans, Moving \u0026 Storage, Real Estate/Construction, Restaurant \u0026 Bar Chains, Retail/E-commerce, Telecommunications, Travel, Utilities, Wealth Management\n\nFor a full list of verticals and its intents see [https://www.bitext.com/chatbot-verticals/](https://www.bitext.com/chatbot-verticals/).\n\nThe question/answer pairs have been generated using a hybrid methodology that uses natural texts as source text, NLP technology to extract seeds from these texts, and NLG technology to expand the seed texts. All steps in the process are curated by computational linguists.\n\n## Dataset Token Count\n\nThe dataset contains an extensive amount of text data across its \u0027instruction\u0027 and \u0027response\u0027 columns. After processing and tokenizing the dataset, we\u0027ve identified a total of 3.57 million tokens. This rich set of tokens is essential for training advanced LLMs for AI Conversational, AI Generative, and Question and Answering (Q\u0026A) models.\n\n## Fields of the Dataset\n\nEach entry in the dataset contains the following fields:\n\n- flags: tags (explained below in the Language Generation Tags section)\n- instruction: a user request from the Customer Service domain\n- category: the high-level semantic category for the intent\n- intent: the intent corresponding to the user instruction\n- response: an example expected response from the virtual assistant\n\n## Categories and Intents\n\nThe categories and intents covered by the dataset are:\n\n- ACCOUNT: create_account, delete_account, edit_account, recover_password, registration_problems, switch_account\n- CANCELLATION_FEE: check_cancellation_fee\n- CONTACT: contact_customer_service, contact_human_agent\n- DELIVERY: delivery_options, delivery_period\n- FEEDBACK: complaint, review\n- INVOICE: check_invoice, get_invoice\n- ORDER: cancel_order, change_order, place_order, track_order\n- PAYMENT: check_payment_methods, payment_issue\n- REFUND: check_refund_policy, get_refund, track_refund\n- SHIPPING_ADDRESS: change_shipping_address, set_up_shipping_address\n- SUBSCRIPTION: newsletter_subscription\n\n## Entities\n\nThe entities covered by the dataset are:\n\n- {{Order Number}}, typically present in:\n- Intents: cancel_order, change_order, change_shipping_address, check_invoice, check_refund_policy, complaint, delivery_options, delivery_period, get_invoice, get_refund, place_order, track_order, track_refund\n- {{Invoice Number}}, typically present in:\n  -

So if an utterance for intent \u201Ccancel_order\u201D contains the \u201CCOLLOQUIAL\u201D tag, the utterance will express an informal language variation like: \u201Ccan u cancel my order\u201D.\n\nThese tags indicate the type of language variation that the entry expresses. When associated to each entry, they allow Conversational Designers to customize training datasets to different user profiles with different uses of language. Through these tags, many different datasets can be created to make the resulting assistant more accurate and robust. A bot that sells sneakers should be mainly targeted to younger population that use a more colloquial language; while a classical retail banking bot should be able to handle more formal or polite language. The dataset also reflects commonly occurring linguistic phenomena of real-life virtual assistant, such as spelling mistakes, run-on words, punctuation errors\u2026\n\nThe dataset contains tagging for all relevant linguistic phenomena that can be used to customize the dataset for different user profiles.\n\n### Tags for Lexical variation\n\nM - Morphological variation: inflectional and derivational\n\u201Cis my SIM card active\u201D, \u201Cis my SIM card activated\u201D\n\nL - Semantic variations: synonyms, use of hyphens, compounding\u2026\n\u201Cwhat\u2019s my billing date\u0022, \u201Cwhat\u2019s my anniversary date\u201D\n\n### Tags for Syntactic structure variation\n\nB - Basic syntactic structure:\n\u201Cactivate my SIM card\u201D, \u201CI need to activate my SIM card\u201D\n\nI - Interrogative structure\n\u201Ccan you activate my SIM card?\u201D, \u201Chow do I activate my SIM card?\u201D\n\nC - Coordinated syntactic structure\n\u201CI have a new SIM card, what do I need to do to activate it?\u201D\n\nN - Negation\n\u201CI do not want this item, where to cancel my order?\u201D\n\n### Tags for language register variations\n\nP - Politeness variation\n\u201Ccould you help me activate my SIM card, please?\u201D\n\nQ - Colloquial variation\n\u201Ccan u activ8 my SIM?\u201D\n\nW - Offensive language\n\u201CI want to talk to a f*\u0026%*g agent\u201D\n\n### Tags for stylistic variations\n\nK - Keyword mode\n\u0022activate SIM\u0022, \u0022new SIM\u0022\n\nE - Use of abbreviations:\n\u201CI\u0027m / I am interested in getting a new SIM\u201D\n\nZ - Errors and Typos: spelling issues, wrong punctuation\u2026\n\u201Chow can i activaet my card\u201D\n\n### Other tags not in use in this Dataset\n\nD - Indirect speech\n\u201Cask my agent to activate my SIM card\u201D\n\nG - Regional variations\nUS English vs UK English: \u0022truck\u0022 vs \u0022lorry\u0022\nFrance French vs Canadian French: \u0022tchatter\u0022 vs \u0022clavarder\u0022\n\nR - Respect structures - Language-dependent variations\nEnglish: \u0022may\u0022 vs \u0022can\u2026\u0022\nFrench: \u0022tu\u0022 vs \u0022vous...\u0022\nSpanish: \u0022t\u00FA\u0022 vs \u0022usted...\u0022\n\nY - Code switching\n\u201Cactiver ma SIM card\u201D\n\n---\n\n(c) Bitext Innovations, 2024"}
